            <p>
                PizzaAwesome uses traditional recipes that were developed after a lot of research. We cook our dish
                in a traditional way with techniques that were developed thousands of years ago by our great-great grandmothers.
                Our Italian dishes will bring back your childhood memories of Pizza and Pasta created by your grand-mothers. We use traditional
                mud ovens to cook and bake dishes. Our Pasta and Pizza dough are made in-house and baked fresh.

            <p>PizzaAwesome uses Original and Fresh Ingredients which are imported every morning from farms.

                if a single quality check is failed, we discard all the ingredients and import fresh ones.
